## Glossary of Terms
- **Voltage**: The electrical potential difference between two points, measured in volts. It drives the current through a circuit.
- **Current**: The flow of electric charge, measured in amperes. It represents the movement of electrons through a conductor.
- **Resistance**: A material's opposition to the flow of electric current, measured in ohms. It determines how much current will flow for a given voltage.
- **Load Balancing**: The process of distributing electrical load evenly across a power grid to optimize efficiency and prevent overloads.
- **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)**: A communication framework that emphasizes empathy and understanding, focusing on expressing needs and feelings without blame or criticism.
- **Renewable Energy**: Energy from sources that are naturally replenishing, such as solar or wind power.
- **Circular Economy**: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling.
- **Leave No Trace**: A set of principles promoting conservation in the outdoors by minimizing human impact on the environment.
- **Smart Grids**: Electrical grids that use digital technology to monitor and manage electricity flow, improving efficiency and reliability.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Maintenance strategies that use data analytics to predict and prevent equipment failures before they occur.
